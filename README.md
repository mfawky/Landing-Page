# Landing-Page
Its a landing-page project that is monitored by Udacity team which focuses mostly on some javascript features and some manipulating with the DOM.


## Languages and tools used:
- HTML
- css
- Javascript 
- The tool I used is VS Code (Visual Studio Code).
- I used Fork Application to help me clone, push or pull anything from or to my repo.


## Some Functionalities:
- The navigation that is built dynamically 
- The scrolling action
- The active state for each section


## What I learned from this project:
I learned how to control my webpage and how to add some interesting 
features using Javascript and the DOM, how to write my code in an 
understandable way that makes it easier for any one to read and ofcourse
how to add comments to my code that simplifies what i did to the reader.


## How to use it or apply on your device:

First: you ca clone this repository and open your index.html with your used IDE and link the css and js files to the html file

Second: then you can open the index.html using the browser to the features after linking the two files to the html file

Third: if you want to take a look on the code you could access form the browser by pressing (inspect)
or by opening the files via your IDE.
